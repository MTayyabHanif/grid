# Another grid framework, really?

This is a tiny SASS-file I made for creating beautiful, completely responsive grids without hassle.

Before I created it, I was using other grid-frameworks like the one that's integrated within Bootstrap. So I thought it might be a good idea to create my own one, since the other ones are mostly just huge amounts of SASS-code.

I made it more complex, but therefore way smaller when it comes to the file size.

# Future

This is still a great way to create websites and structure them within a layout, so I'd still encourage you to use this code. But to be fair, there's a better solution coming (which isn't implemented in all browsers yet) - you can read about it [here][1]. Have fun with it ;)
